# ChatRoom
a chatroom site, currently under developement for further features to be added
For now development has stopped due to various reasons, might continue later
Since it was a project meant for learning and as yet the refactoring has not been completed for deployment, 
the code is somewhat poorly structured, but the functionallity of the program is quick and stable(i haven't tested it a lot tho, so there might be minor bugs)
How to use:
1- Run the app.py
2- Proceed to the site address (if it is deployed on a local machine it is located at localhost:5000)
3- you can then register and will be redirected to the main page
